Files are recorded with Audacity in an open room, sometimes with air conditioner running. Definitely not high quality audio.

Recorded in response to Google+ post by Thomas Pfeiffer https://plus.google.com/115138436279578375375/posts/CWfrGskBhjC

===Filename Key===

* First part of filename is the word, as spelled on wikipedia article today, http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_German_expressions_in_English&oldid=491264058
** So far, only have done the "Food and drink" section

* If filename has a "_0" after it, it means it's a word I know and would possibly use in everyday English in the USA (I'm from Michigan / live in New Mexico)
* If filename has a "_1" after it, it means I've possibly heard the word before, but wouldn't probably ever use it in my spoken language
* If filename has a "_2" after it, it means I've never heard of the word before.
* If filename has a "_2" after it, it means I've never heard of the word before and I don't even know all the characters used to spell it

* If after the underscore/number there is an A / B it means I provide two alternate pronounciations. 

Enjoy!!!
